Following Casey Muratori's Handmade Hero

I try to catch up on Casey's brilliant Handmade Hero when I have the time to. 

I'm using SDL to program on Mac OS X for exposing the frame buffer, sound and keyboard/gamepad input. Also I'm using SDL's abstractions for primitives and some malloc and library loading funtions since making them work on multiple system would be rather trivial and I'm more interested in game development than system libraries.

As for conventions, I'm following Google's C++ Style Guide (http://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Naming) on naming and a few other things, so this deviates from Casey.
