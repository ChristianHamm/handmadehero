Following Casey Muratori's Handmade Hero (https://handmadehero.org/)

I try to catch up on Casey's brilliant Handmade Hero when I have the time to.

I'm using Clang in conjunction with SDL's C library to program on Mac OS X for exposing the frame buffer, sound and keyboard/gamepad input. My IDE is CLion from JetBrains. Also I'm using SDL's abstractions for primitives and some malloc and library loading funtions since making them work on multiple systems would be rather trivial and I'm more interested in game development than system libraries.

As for conventions, I'm following Google's C++ Style Guide (http://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Naming) on naming and a few other things, so my code deviates from Casey. As this is a personal project I tend to also implement things differently and just play with the code.
